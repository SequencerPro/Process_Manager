## Vision

A system that treats manufacturing (and other business) process designs as the central organizing structure of an enterprise. The process model is the schema from which planning, accounting, sales, EHS, and other functions derive their data. By investing in rigorous process definition, a company maximizes its ability to understand, track, and improve its operations.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Process model is the core.** Everything else is a consumer of or contributor to the process model.
2. **Design together, build incrementally.** The data model for Phases 1–3 is designed as a unit before any code is written, then built phase by phase.
3. **Each phase delivers standalone value.** A manufacturing engineer can benefit from the system before it is "complete."
4. **Domain-neutral internals, domain-specific labels.** The system uses generic terms (Kind, Grade, Item) internally and maps them to user-facing vocabulary (Part, Disposition, Serial Number) via configuration.
5. **Type safety prevents errors.** Ports enforce Item Types (Kind + Grade) so that wrong items cannot flow to wrong places.

---

## Phased Build Sequence

### Phase 1 — Type System (Kind, Grade, Tracking Levels) ✅

**Goal:** Define *what things are.*

**Status:** Implemented — full CRUD API and Blazor UI (KindList, KindDetail with inline grade management)

**Delivers:**
- Ability to catalog all Kinds (parts, materials, documents, etc.)
- Define Grades per Kind (Raw, Passed, Failed-Dimensional, etc.)
- Set tracking flags per Kind (Serialized, Batchable)
- Configure domain vocabulary mapping

**Standalone value:** A formal, searchable parts/materials catalog with classification — replaces spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.

**Key entities:**
- Kind
- Grade
- Domain Vocabulary Config

---

### Phase 2 — Step Design (Steps with Ports) ✅

**Goal:** Define *what work looks like.*

**Status:** Implemented — full CRUD API and Blazor UI (StepTemplateList, StepTemplateDetail with port management)

**Delivers:**
- Design individual Steps with named Input and Output Ports
- Each Port declares exactly one Item Type (Kind + Grade) and a Quantity Rule
- Steps are classified by pattern (Transform, Assembly, Division, General)
- Steps are reusable — designed once, used in multiple Processes

**Standalone value:** Documented operations with formal input/output definitions. Already more rigorous than most shops have.

**Key entities:**
- Step (template/definition)
- Port (Input / Output)
- Quantity Rule

---

### Phase 3 — Process Composition ✅

**Goal:** Arrange Steps into linear sequences.

**Status:** Implemented — full CRUD API and Blazor UI (ProcessList, ProcessDetail with step/flow management, cascading port dropdowns for flow creation, step override editing, process validation endpoint)

**Delivers:**
- Create Processes as ordered sequences of Steps
- Validate port compatibility between consecutive Steps (output ports of step N connect to input ports of step N+1)
- Define Flows (the connections between ports of adjacent steps)
- Version and manage Process definitions

**Standalone value:** Complete process plans (routings) — replaces paper travelers and undocumented tribal knowledge.

**Key entities:**
- Process
- Process Step (a Step placed at a position in a Process)
- Flow (port-to-port connection between adjacent Process Steps)

---

### Phase 4 — Workflow Composition ✅

**Goal:** Connect Processes into directed graphs with routing decisions.

**Status:** Implemented — full CRUD API and Blazor UI (WorkflowList, WorkflowDetail with process/link management, link condition add/remove, Validate button with results panel, edit modals for processes and links)

**Delivers:**
- Workflow CRUD with versioning and active flag
- WorkflowProcess nodes linking Processes into a workflow graph
- WorkflowLink edges with routing types (Always, GradeBased, Manual)
- WorkflowLinkCondition for grade-based routing decisions
- Validation endpoint checking entry points, link completeness, interface compatibility

**Key entities:**
- Workflow
- WorkflowProcess
- WorkflowLink
- WorkflowLinkCondition
- RoutingType enum

---

### Phase 5 — Execution / Runtime ✅

**Goal:** Track real work flowing through designed processes.

**Status:** Implemented — full CRUD API and Blazor UI (JobList/Detail, ItemList/Detail, BatchList/Detail, StepExecutionList/Detail with port transaction creation, execution data capture, lifecycle transitions)

**Delivers:**
- Create and manage Jobs with lifecycle transitions (Created → InProgress → OnHold → Completed/Cancelled)
- Create, track, and flow Items and Batches through Steps
- Record Step Executions with status transitions, port transactions, and data
- Port transaction form with port/item/batch dropdowns driven by job context
- Data association at three levels (Step Execution, Batch, Item)
- Top-level list endpoints for Items, Batches, and StepExecutions with filtering

**Key entities:**
- Job
- Item
- Batch
- StepExecution
- PortTransaction
- ExecutionData

---

### Cross-Cutting Improvements ✅

**Applied across all phases:**
- **Pagination:** All GetAll endpoints return `PaginatedResponse<T>` with `page`, `pageSize`, `totalCount`, `totalPages`, `hasPreviousPage`, `hasNextPage`
- **Search:** All list endpoints accept `?search=` parameter filtering on Code/Name
- **Filtering:** `?active=` on StepTemplates/Processes/Workflows; `?status=` on Jobs/Items/Batches/StepExecutions; `?processId=` on Jobs; `?jobId=`/`?kindId=` on Items/Batches/StepExecutions
- **DTO Validation:** All Create/Update DTOs have `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[Range]` attributes, auto-validated by `[ApiController]`
- **Lightweight Listing:** ProcessesController GetAll returns `ProcessSummaryResponseDto` (no Steps/Flows graph) for performance
- **Type Safety:** ExecutionData DataType uses `DataValueType` enum instead of string
- **Eager Loading:** All Item and Batch queries include `.Include(Job)` and `.Include(Batch)` so response DTOs carry `JobName` and `BatchCode` for display without extra round-trips
- **UI Polish:** Delete confirmations (JS `confirm()`) on all destructive actions; empty-state messages on all list tables; friendly names (JobName, BatchCode) in list views instead of raw GUIDs

---

### Phase 6 — Production Infrastructure (in progress)

**Goal:** Make the system deployable in real multi-user environments.

**Completed:**
- **PostgreSQL:** SQLite replaced with PostgreSQL (Npgsql 8.0.11). `Program.cs` includes a `ToNpgsqlConnectionString()` helper that converts the `postgresql://` URL injected by Render into an Npgsql-compatible connection string. `appsettings.json` carries a localhost default for development; the production connection string is supplied via environment variable.
- **EF Core Migrations:** `Database.EnsureCreated()` replaced with a proper migrations pipeline. `20260301175025_InitialCreate` covers the full initial schema with Npgsql identity column annotations.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based auth with Admin and Engineer roles. Full user management UI (list, add, delete) in the Blazor admin panel.
- **Audit Trail:** `ProcessManagerDbContext.SetAuditFields()` automatically populates `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `CreatedBy`, and `UpdatedBy` on every `SaveChanges`/`SaveChangesAsync` call, using `IHttpContextAccessor` to resolve the current user's username from the JWT principal. All four fields are already in `BaseEntity` and covered by the `InitialCreate` migration — no schema change required.

**Remaining:**
- **Multi-tenancy:** See architecture decision below.

---

## Architecture Decision: Multi-Tenancy (2026-03-02)

### Deployment Models

The system must support two deployment scenarios:
1. **SaaS** — hosted on Render, serving multiple independent companies from the same deployment.
2. **On-premises** — a single company runs the system on their own hardware with their own database.

### Decision: Database-per-Tenant (Option B), deferred until a second real tenant exists

Three options were evaluated:

| Option | Description | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| A: Row-level tenancy | `TenantId` column on every table; single shared database | Rejected for now — invasive to implement, data leakage risk, premature at current scale |
| B: Database-per-tenant | Each tenant gets their own PostgreSQL database; middleware resolves connection string per request | **Selected** — strong isolation, no schema changes, natural fit for both deployment models |
| C: Deployment-per-tenant | Separate Render service + DB per customer (current state) | Fine now, but operationally unscalable beyond a handful of customers |

### How It Works

- A lightweight "management" database holds a `Tenants` table mapping subdomains/identifiers to connection strings.
- A tenant resolver middleware reads the request hostname, looks up the tenant, and selects the appropriate connection string before the request hits any controller.
- Migrations run independently per tenant database using the same migration pipeline already in place.
- On-premises customers provision one database and set `TenancyMode: SingleTenant` in `appsettings.json` — the middleware is bypassed and the connection string comes directly from config.
- **No changes to any entity, query, or migration are required.** The same binaries and Docker image serve both deployment models.

### When to Build It

Do not build multi-tenancy infrastructure until a second real SaaS tenant is being onboarded. The current single-deployment model (Option C) is sufficient until then. If database-per-tenant ever becomes operationally unmanageable at scale (many dozens of tenants), revisit Option A.

---

### Phase 7+ — Integrations (future)

**Goal:** Connect the process system to peripheral business functions.

**Potential integrations:**
- **Accounting:** Material costs, labor costs per step, WIP valuation
- **Planning:** Capacity, scheduling, material requirements
- **Sales:** Product availability, lead times derived from process durations
- **EHS:** Waste tracking, hazardous material flows, compliance reporting
- **Engineering:** Product design changes driving process revisions
- **Quality:** Statistical process control, inspection data analysis

Each integration is a consumer of execution data shaped by the process model. They can be added incrementally without redesigning the core.

---

## Current State (as of 2026-03-02)

All five phases are fully implemented. Phase 6 is in progress — PostgreSQL, EF Core migrations, authentication/authorization, and audit trail are complete. The system is deployable to Render.com.

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| API | ASP.NET Core 8 Web API |
| Frontend | Blazor Server (SSR + InteractiveServer render mode) |
| ORM | Entity Framework Core 8 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (production/development via Npgsql); in-memory SQLite for tests |
| Test framework | xUnit with `WebApplicationFactory` integration tests |
| Styling | Bootstrap 5 + Bootstrap Icons |
| Version control | Git / GitHub (SequencerPro/Process_Manager) |

### Test Coverage

164 integration tests across all phases, all passing. Tests run against an in-memory SQLite database spun up per test run.

### Blazor UI Pages (17 total)

| Page | Features |
|---|---|
| KindList / KindDetail | CRUD, inline grade management, delete confirmations |
| StepTemplateList / StepTemplateDetail | CRUD, port management, pattern/qty rule display |
| ProcessList / ProcessDetail | CRUD, step management, cascading port dropdowns for flows, step editing, validation |
| WorkflowList / WorkflowDetail | CRUD, process/link management, link condition add/remove (grade badges), Validate button |
| JobList / JobDetail | CRUD, lifecycle transitions, step execution navigation |
